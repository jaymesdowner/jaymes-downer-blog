I have a confession. Sometimes I get really overwhelmed with life. There are just so many freakin things to do.  Not only are there a ton of chores that need to be completed, but then theres all the other categories in life like reading, learning new things, eating healthy, working out, big projects like garage doors that have been broken for a year…the list goes on and on.

You see, I have a hard time separating these tasks. When I manage to get some free time I have a hard time checking any of these things off of my list, which is a made up thing in my head. I may have a couple hours where I don’t really have anything going on and I could knock out a couple of the things on my ‘list’, but instead I run away from the monster of uncompleted tasks. This year I only have one resolution..

Do One Thing.

I’m going to start by making a list of all the things that are in my head. Large projects, small projects, daily tasks, they will all be written down. Most times I don’t complete a task because in the moment I forget how badly I want to do it. I’m hoping that having these tasks written down will help me to knock them off one by one. 

That is going to be the key this year- ‘One by One’ I’m not going to fix the garage today, and finish reading that book, and learn something new, and eat the healthiest meal I’ve ever eaten…but I will make it my goal to do one of those things. Just one. Then tomorrow I will tackle something new.  My list might not ever be a slate clean of tasks, and thats really ok. I’m learning life isn’t about finishing all the things, it’s about living and doing things.  So this is check mark number one. Actually sitting down and writing this out and getting it out of my head. I did the dishes earlier too…I’m kinda kickin’ ass today!
