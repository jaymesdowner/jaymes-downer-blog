title: Living To Your Full Potential
description: What does it look like to get the most out of yourself?
---
The 2015 NBA Finals just finished up last week, and I caught myself seeing more than just some guys playing a game with a ball on the tv. This year, I noticed a select few individuals that really stood head and shoulders above the rest.

There is a popular video going around now that keys in on Steph Curry’s work ethic, and the fact that his success is not an accident. See, I use to think that there were just people who were destined to be great. A few years ago, I would have looked at Steph and said, ‘It’s crazy to see people who are doing what they were designed to do.’ Now, to a degree, there is truth in that. But at the end of the day, Steph wasn’t designed to be a basketball player. If he wanted too, he could of done a handful of other things with his life.

He was, however, called to follow Christ, and called to lead his family with love and humility. That is something he could have done with any career choice.

When he decided to pursue the game of basketball, he did it with everything he had. He didn’t go at it half-hearted. He trained for hours and hours to perfect a skill that would allow him to be one of the best players in the NBA.

There is something inspiring about seeing someone be the best at whatever it is they may be doing.

I wonder what it would look like if more people gave that kind of devotion to their passion. It doesn’t have to be basketball. What can I do as a web developer to push myself to be one of the best? Why am I not doing that?

Life is too short to just float by and be average. I want to be someone that people look up to and say, ‘that’s a guy thats giving it everything he has.’ More importantly, when they look at me, I want them to see me loving and leading my family, and being loved and lead by Christ.
