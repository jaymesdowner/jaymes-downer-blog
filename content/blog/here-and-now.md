This weekend I went out with a couple of my close friends. That 24 hour period was one of the best I’ve had in quite some time. Typically I’d have more than a few photos on my iPhone to prove my point, or at least try to. I made a decision this weekend though. I decided that I wanted to be present the whole weekend. Part of that was deciding not to pull the ol’ camera out quite as many times, or at all if possible.

I’ve spent too many nights worrying about capturing that perfect scene to Instagram or Vine. Don’t think this is a post about me pledging to give up social media for the rest of my life, because it’s not. It’s simply a realization that at times I worry too much about showing the world the awesome stuff I’m doing that I end up not just enjoying my time

I’m all for tweeting it up, and even posting sweet pics, I just don’t want to miss out on all the awesome stuff going on around me.
