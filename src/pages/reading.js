        <h3>Radical Candor</h3>
        <p>If you haven't read <i>Radical Candor</i>, please don't waste anymore time on my website. <b>Go read this book now!</b> All joking aside, this booked helped me speak more candidly to my boss, my direct reports, and my wife; all without being an a**hole (as the author so gracefully puts it). This is one of the best books on communication I have ever read.</p>

        <h3>Work Rules</h3>
        <p>If you are looking for a general playbook on how to setup and lead your organization, definitely give this a shot! This helped me understand hiring, development plans, and how to truly care for your team. Packed with tons of great insight.</p>

        <h3>Trillion Dollar Coach</h3>
        <p>This is the incedible story of Bill Campbell and his leadership that helped so my companies push past failure to success. There are some amazing stories in this thing! I'm a coach at heart, so I definitely coonect with Bill.</p>

        <h3>Soul Keeping: Caring for the Most Important Part of You</h3>
        <p>I honestly need to read this book at least once a year. It's a great reminder that you are your most valuable asset. If you feel like you are going 100mph and are spent, take a day off and read this book.</p>
