        <p></p>
        <p>I lead a team of distributed designers and engineers that are responsible for building and maintaining multiple products for F&M (Filmsupply & Musicbed). <b>My primary goal is to invest in my team and help each team member see and reach their full potential.</b> I work on our Executive Lead Team and help set the vision and roadmap for all of our products.</p>
        <p><b>I'm passionate about the intersection of technology and people.</b> I love working on products that make peoples lives better! I also love the opportunity that working in technology brings to everyone on my team!</p>

        <h4 style={tightH4}>Vice President of Product</h4>
        <p><i>F&M | Sept 2019 - Present</i></p>
        <p>As VP of Product, I had 3 main objectives when I started:</p>
        <p><b>Increase diversity of our Product Team.</b> I believe the current software industry is a gift, and one worth sharing. The opportunities available right now have the ability to drastically change someones life. When I took over the team, it was primarily white males. I wanted that to change. Since then, I've had the pleasure of hiring four engineers. Three of those engineers are Black. Two are Black females. This use to make me a bit uncomfortable for some reason. <b>But I believe it's our responsibility to reach deeper into the pool of candidates to find underrepresented individuals and give them an opportunity.</b></p>
        <p><b>Create a clear career path for all Designers and Engineers to help inspire and motivate growth.</b> Expectations were not clear for all team members, and few people knew what they could do to grow and increase ownership and compensation.</p>
        <p><b>Create a clear and transparent salary structure.</b> Over the years, people were brought in at much different salaries based on the state of the company at the time. <b>I needed to create a new system that rewarded scope of influence, knowledge, skill level, and ownership.</b> This created some large disparaties between team members that wasn't necessary. Some of our more tenured team members received raises to get them in line with my newly outlined structure.</p>
        <p>My focus was primarily on the individuals on my team, so I needed to pair that with some organizational changes and procedures to help these individuals be as successful as possible, and help our products be a success as well. I transitioned our team from a flat structure to a structure of leads that could help train the less experienced team members. This has been a huge success! I have not hired a Director of Engineering, so I maintain most of those responsibilities currently.</p>
